## History about disco

I, Alexandru Mariuti, started creating what became Disco in `flutter_solidart` with the `Solid` widget a long time ago (Feb 28, 2023 with [this PR](https://github.com/nank1ro/solidart/commit/9368fec399560e725493c3204d9cf51df218e805)).
The `Solid` widget is very similar to `ProviderScope` here on Disco.

Manuel helped me to improve the `Solid` widget in many PRs and one day we decided to extract the `Solid` widget into a separate package called `disco`.
We refactored the `Solid` widget, removing the strong dependency on `flutter_solidart`.

Manuel is the one who came up with the name `disco` and also the one who made providers more compile-safe without having to type `context.get<Model>()` everywhere (which is more error prone than `modelProvider.of(context)` because you have to specity `<Model>` every time).
