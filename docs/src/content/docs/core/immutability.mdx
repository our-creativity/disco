import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In Disco, providers are immutable. This means that once a provider is created, it cannot be changed.

This is a design choice that we made to ensure that the instance of the provider is consistent throughout the application.

Let's look at an example, think a bit about the output after the `FloatingActionButton` is pressed, then continue reading to see if you were correct.

```dart
import 'package:disco/disco.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MainApp());
}

final counterProvider =
    Provider.withArgument((context, Counter counter) => counter);

class Counter {
  Counter(this.value);

  final int value;
}

class MainApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MainApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<MainApp> createState() => _MainAppState();
}

class _MainAppState extends State<MainApp> {
  var counter = Counter(0);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Immutability',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ProviderScope(
        providers: [
          counterProvider(counter),
        ],
        child: Scaffold(
          body: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              return Center(
                child: Text('The counter is ${counterProvider.of(context).value}'),
              );
            },
          ),
          floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              setState(() {
                counter = Counter(counter.value + 1);
              });
            },
            child: const Icon(Icons.add),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The example renders `The counter is 0`. After the user presses the `FloatingActionButton`, the counter is incremented, but the UI does not update.
This is because the provider is immutable, and the instance of the provider is not updated. In other words, the `counterProvider` is created only the first time and it still provides the initial instance.

You may be skeptical about the immutability of providers, but it is actually a good thing.
It helps avoid bugs and makes the application more predictable.

The typical usage for a provider is to provide a value for a specific page or widget.
When the page or widget is disposed, the provider gets also disposed, and the value is no longer available.
When the Page is opened again, a new instance of the provider is created, and the value is provided again.

### Force the recreation of a provider

There is one way to force the recreation of a provider, _which we discourage_, but can be used if you know what you are doing.

```dart {2}
ProviderScope(
  key: ValueKey(counter),
  providers: [
    counterProvider(counter),
  ],
  child: ..
)
```

When changing a key, the widget subtree gets regenerated.
The provider recreation is performed inside the `ProviderScope` widget. What exactly happens is the following:

1. The old `ProviderScope` is disposed, which disposes of all the providers inside it.
2. A new `ProviderScope` is created and all the providers are created again.
