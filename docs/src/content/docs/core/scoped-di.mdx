In this library, scoped dependency injection (DI) refers to injecting providers
that are confined to a specific scope.

To make things clearer in this section, let’s take a look at two of the providers from the previous page.

```dart
final numberProvider = Provider((context) => 5);

final doubleNumberPlusArgProvider = Provider.withArgument((context, int arg) {
  final number = numberProvider.of(context);
  return number * 2 + arg;
});
```

### How to scope

Scoping means that the provider must be specified within a `ProviderScope` before it can be injected.

In case the provider does not take an argument, we scope it the following way:

```dart
ProviderScope(
  providers: [numberProvider]
  child: // ...
)
```

In case the provider takes an argument, we need to specify it when providing it.

```dart
ProviderScope(
  providers: [doubleNumberPlusArgProvider(10)]
  child: // ...
)
```

### How to inject

Injecting is the act of retrieving a dependency. It is done with the methods `of(context)` and `maybeOf(context)`, the latter one being safer because it returns null instead of throwing if the provider is not found in any scopes.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you are unsure about which one to use, for simplicity you should probably stick to `of(context)`.
</Aside>

We inject the two providers above by using the `numberProvider.of(context)` and `doubleNumberPlusArgProvider.of(context)`.

<Aside>
  Users transitioning from Provider or Riverpod should note an important distinction: this library does not include reactivity. Therefore, it does not provide equivalents to `context.watch`/`context.listen` or `ref.watch`/`ref.listen`. The only way to trigger a rebuild is by changing the key of the `ProviderScope`, which is not recommended by us. Instead, we advise injecting observables/signals directly and using their corresponding widgets or helpers to react to changes.

### Full example

Try and guess what the displayed text will be before reading the solution.

```dart
runApp(
  MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      body: ProviderScope(
        providers: [numberProvider],
        child: ProviderScope(
          providers: [doubleNumberPlusArgProvider(10)],
          child: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              final number = numberProvider.of(context);
              final doubleNumberPlusArg = doubleNumberPlusArgProvider.of(context);
              return Text('$number $doubleNumberPlusArg');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

The solution is "5 20".

## Scoping correctly with context

Some providers might have a dependency on other providers. It is important that the other providers are provided in `ProviderScope`s that are ancestors to the `ProviderScope` providing the dependent provider.

### Wrong example

The scope containing `doubleNumberPlusArgProvider` needs to be a descendant of the one containing `numberProvider`.
This is because `doubleNumberPlusArgProvider` uses the context to find the value of `numberProvider`. The following will thus **not** work:

```dart
// bad example
ProviderScope(
  providers: [
    numberProvider,
    doubleNumberPlusArgProvider(10),
  ],
  child: // ...
)
```

Placing the `ProviderScope` containing `doubleNumberPlusArgProvider` above the one containing `numberProvider` would also not work. It needs to be like in the full example above.

## Graphical representation

When you inject a provider, you need to ensure that one of the ancestors of the widget — where the injection takes place — is a `ProviderScope` providing that provider. If this is not the case, an error will be thrown at runtime.
Refer to the graph below to understand the problem.

<ThemeImage src="/provider-scope-exception.svg" darkSrc="/provider-scope-exception_dark.svg" alt="Graphical representation of provider scope exception"/>

If you lift the provider scope up to the parent of the widget, the injection will work as expected.

<ThemeImage src="/provider-scope.svg" darkSrc="/provider-scope_dark.svg" alt="Graphical representation of provider scope"/>
