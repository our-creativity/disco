In this library, scoped dependency injection (DI) refers to injecting providers
that are confined to a specific scope.

To make things clearer in this section, let’s take a look at two of the providers from the previous page.

```dart
final numberProvider = Provider((context) => 5);

final doubleNumberPlusArgProvider = Provider.withArgument((context, int arg) {
  final number = numberProvider.of(context);
  return number * 2 + arg;
});
```

### How to scope

Scoping means that the provider must be specified within a `ProviderScope` before it can be injected.

In case the provider does not take an argument, we scope it the following way:

```dart
ProviderScope(
  providers: [numberProvider]
  child: // ...
)
```

In case the provider takes an argument, we need to specify it when providing it.

```dart
ProviderScope(
  providers: [doubleNumberPlusArgProvider(10)]
  child: // ...
)
```

### How to inject

Injecting is the act of retrieving a dependency. It is done with the methods `of(context)` and `maybeOf(context)`, the latter one being safer because it returns null instead of throwing if the provider is not found in any scopes.

In full example below, we are going to inject the two providers above with `numberProvider.of(context)` and `doubleNumberPlusArgProvider.of(context)`.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you are unsure about which one to use, for simplicity you should probably stick to `of(context)`.
</Aside>

<Aside>
  Users transitioning from Provider or Riverpod should note an important distinction: this library does not include reactivity. Therefore, it does not provide equivalents to `context.watch`/`context.listen` or `ref.watch`/`ref.listen`. The only way to trigger a rebuild is by changing the key of the `ProviderScope`, which is not recommended by us (the next section explains this in detail). Instead, we advise injecting observables/signals directly and using their corresponding widgets or helpers to react to changes.

### Full example

Try and guess what the displayed text will be before reading the solution.

```dart
runApp(
  MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      body: ProviderScope(
        providers: [numberProvider, doubleNumberPlusArgProvider],
        child: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              final number = numberProvider.of(context);
              final doubleNumberPlusArg = doubleNumberPlusArgProvider.of(context);
              return Text('$number $doubleNumberPlusArg');
            },
          ),
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

The solution is "5 20".

## Scoping correctly with context

Some providers might have a dependency on other providers, to handle such cases, you can:
1. Access another provider if it is declared in an ancestor `ProviderScope`.
2. Declare the dependent provider after the provider it depends on, within the same `ProviderScope`. The order of declaration matters here otherwise a `ProviderForwardReferenceError` will be thrown at runtime.

### Wrong example

The provider `doubleNumberPlusArgProvider` depends on `numberProvider`. Therefore, when scoping them both in the same `ProviderScope`, `numberProvider` must be declared first.

```dart title="Wrong example"
ProviderScope(
  providers: [
    doubleNumberPlusArgProvider(10),
    numberProvider,
  ],
  child: // ...
)
```

to make it work, just swap the order of declaration:

```dart title="Correct example"
ProviderScope(
  providers: [
    numberProvider,
    doubleNumberPlusArgProvider(10),
  ],
  child: // ...
)
```

## Graphical representation

When you inject a provider, you need to ensure that one of the ancestors of the widget — where the injection takes place — is a `ProviderScope` providing that provider. If this is not the case, an error will be thrown at runtime.
Refer to the graph below to understand the problem.

<ThemeImage src="/provider-scope-exception.svg" darkSrc="/provider-scope-exception_dark.svg" alt="Graphical representation of provider scope exception"/>

If you lift the provider scope up to the parent of the widget, the injection will work as expected.

<ThemeImage src="/provider-scope.svg" darkSrc="/provider-scope_dark.svg" alt="Graphical representation of provider scope"/>
