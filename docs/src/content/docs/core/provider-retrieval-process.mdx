Refer to the following graph to understand how the providers are retrieved.

### Steps

1. When a provider is injected, the first thing that is checked is if a `ProviderScopeOverride` exists.

2. If it does, its internal map of overridden providers is checked to see if the provider is there.

3. If is there, the overridden value is returned.

4. Otherwise, the search continues for the first `ProviderScope` ancestor.

5. If a `ProviderScope` ancestor is found, the provider is searched in the providers map.

6. If the provider is found, its value is returned. It the value was not computed yet (i.e. it is the first time a lazy provider is accessed), it will get created before it is returned.

7. If the provider is not found, the search proceeds to the next `ProviderScope` ancestor, continuing recursively up the widget tree until the root is reached.

8. If the provider is not found, a `ProviderWithoutScopeError` is thrown.

<Aside type="tip">
  The error can be avoided by using `provider.maybeOf(context)`, which returns `null` if the provider is not found.

<Aside>
The lookup of a provider is __O(1)__ because it just involves a map lookup, in addition the tree is traversed using [getElementForInheritedWidgetOfExactType](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext/getElementForInheritedWidgetOfExactType.html), which is O(1) because it jumps from one InheritedWidget of type `T` to another, skipping the widgets in between.
