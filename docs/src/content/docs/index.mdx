Disco is a library introducing a new concept of providers that operate differently from those already present in the Flutter ecosystem. It was developed to overcome the challenges and limitations in the context of dependency injection.

## Simple usage example

The package supports many features, like providers that accept arguments. But to keep things simple, here is a basic example to get you started:

1. Define a provider at the top level.

    ```dart {1}
    final modelProvider = Provider((context) => Model());
    ```

    **Note:** the state is never stored globally, directly in the Provider instance; see this provider solely as a type-safe identifier.

2. Insert a `ProviderScope` at the desired point in the widget tree to define the scope of the provider and make it accessible to the corresponding subtree.

    ```dart {1, 2, 3, 4}
    ProviderScope(
      providers: [modelProvider],
      child: MyWidget(),
    )
    ```

    **Note:** the actual state for the provider is created and stored inside the `ProviderScope` instance where the provider is referenced.
    This way, when the ProviderScope gets disposed, the state gets disposed — making it ideal for managing **local state**.

3. Inject the provider directly inside a new stateless widget or a stateful widget's state.

    ```dart {7}
    class InjectingWidget extends StatelessWidget {

      const InjectingWidget({super.key});

      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        final model = modelProvider.of(context);
        // return .. (use model here)
      }
    }
    ```

    **Note:** the `ProviderScope` defined in step 2 needs to be an ancestor of this `InjectingWidget` widget.

### Expanded: Widget tree structure

To make things clear, here is the widget tree structure from the example above, shown in the most detailed form:

* `modelProvider` — a globally defined provider

* `main` — the entry point of every Dart application, also global

  * ... — setup widget(s)

    * `ProviderScope` — *`modelProvider` is provided here*

      * `MyWidget` — the child defined in the second code snippet if you notice carefully

        * ... — widget(s)

          * `InjectingWidget` — *`modelProvider` is injected here*

            * ... — widget(s)

</details>

## What makes this library unique

Dependency injection in Flutter is most commonly associated with libraries like [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) and [Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod), both of which have significantly influenced how developers manage state and dependencies. Provider supports a simple, widget-tree–aligned scoping model, but does not allow multiple providers of the same type. Riverpod, on the other hand, supports multiple providers of the same type, but does so through a globally structured architecture that breaks away from the widget tree.

If you would like to understand the pain points of Provider and Riverpod more in detail, see our separate short article [here](https://github.com/our-creativity/disco/blob/main/glimpse-into-other-DI-approaches.md).

### Disco: The best of both worlds

**Disco** builds on the strengths of both while taking a different path. It is — **to our knowledge** — the **first and only solution** that supports **multiple providers of the same type** (without wrapper types or string keys) using a model that remains **fully local and naturally integrated into the Flutter widget tree** — while reducing the downsides of both to a minimum.

#### Providers as identifiers

You define providers as top-level identifiers. They can be of the same generic type, as in the example below.

```dart
final modelProvider = Provider((context) => Model());
final secondModelProvider = Provider((context) => Model());
```

Disco uses the **provider instance**, not the return type, to locate dependencies — allowing multiple providers of the same type *without confusion*.

#### Scoped where you need it

You insert a `ProviderScope` **where** you want the providers to be active — no global registry required.

```dart
ProviderScope(
  providers: [modelProvider, secondModelProvider],
  child: MyWidget(),
)
```

This is **true scoping**, fully aligned with the widget tree.

#### Clean and type-safe injection

No special widget base class is needed. Just call the `of` (or `maybeOf` if optional) method of the provider:

```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final model = modelProvider.of(context);
    final secondModel = secondModelProvider.of(context);

    return Text(model.toString() + " " + secondModel.toString());
  }
}
```

Of course, the providers don’t need to be defined in the same scope to be used together, and they don’t need to be injected in the same widget either. This setup is just meant to demonstrate what’s possible.

## Trade-offs

### Pros

The pros of Disco are:

- The providers are scoped.
  - The widget tree is fully leveraged.
    - This keeps the architecture simple.
- No global state is possible.
  - Circular dependencies are impossible.
- Multiple providers of the same type are possible.
  - There is no need to create wrapper types or rely on IDs such as strings.
- The API is very simple and feels natural to Flutter.
  - Providers are equipped with `of(context)` and `maybeOf(context)` methods.
  - All you need is `BuildContext`. There is no additional class needed to inject the providers.
- The removal of a provider has an impact on its providing and each of its injections.
  - Each of them is immediately characterized by a static error.
- The values held by the providers are immutable.
  - While immutable, some instances allow for inner mutation.
    - This is great: observables and signals can be passed down.
- No reactivity is included.
  - This library focuses on DI, so that state management solutions can focus on the reactivity.
  - To include reactivity, provide a built-in or third-party observable/signal to the provider (e.g. `Signal`, `ChangeNotifier`, `Cubit`, ...).

### Cons

The cons of this library are:

- Providers might need to be lifted up or down in the widget tree, as requirements change.
- Modals spawn new widget trees, causing disconnection with the providers in the main tree.
  - A special widget must be used to restore access to the providers in the main widget tree.
- It is not fully compile-time safe.
  - The injection of a provider that cannot be found in any scope results in a runtime error.

In Disco's defense regarding the last point:

- Total compile-time safety is not possible with an approach leveraging scoped DI, which is a pattern ubiquitously used in Flutter and third-party libraries (think about how many times you have already read `MediaQuery.of(context)`, `GoRouter.of(context)`, ...).
- Disco providers also have a `maybeOf(context)` method, which can help if the presence of a provider cannot be guaranteed.
- The throwable includes precise information in its stack trace to deduce the missing provider: filepath, line and column.

### Keep in mind

As the <a href="/authors">authors of Disco</a>, we believe this to be the most effective strategy for DI in Flutter. However, every solution has trade-offs. You can limit the impact of these trade-offs by running tests, doing code reviews, and following other crucial practices.
