Disco is a library introducing a new concept of providers that operate differently from those already present in the Flutter ecosystem. It was developed to overcome the challenges and limitations in the context of dependency injection.

## Usage

### Creating a provider

```dart
final modelProvider = Provider((context) => Model());
```

### Providing a provider

```dart
ProviderScope(
  providers: [modelProvider],
  child: MyWidget(),
)
```

### Retrieving a provider
```dart
final model = modelProvider.of(context);
```

You can retrieve a provider from any widget in the subtree of the `ProviderScope` where the provider has been provided.

To get straight to the point, pros and cons are summarized below.

### Pros

The pros of Disco are:

- The providers are scoped.
  - The widget tree is fully leveraged.
    - This keeps the architecture simple.
- No global state is possible.
  - Circular dependencies are impossible.
- Multiple providers of the same type are possible.
  - There is no need to create wrapper types or rely on IDs such as strings.
- The API is very simple and feels natural to Flutter.
  - Providers are equipped with `of(context)` and `maybeOf(context)` methods.
  - All you need is `BuildContext`. There is no additional class needed to inject the providers.
- The removal of a provider has an impact on its providing and each of its injections.
  - Each of them is immediately characterized by a static error.
- The values held by the providers are immutable.
  - While immutable, some instances allow for inner mutation.
    - This is great: observables and signals can be passed down.
- No reactivity is included.
  - This library focuses on DI, so that state management solutions can focus on the reactivity.
  - To include reactivity, provide a built-in or third-party observable/signal to the provider (e.g. `Signal`, `ChangeNotifier`, `Cubit`, ...).

### Cons

The cons of this library are:

- Providers might need to be lifted up or down in the widget tree, as requirements change.
- Modals spawn new widget trees, causing disconnection with the providers in the main tree.
  - A special widget must be used to restore access to the providers in the main widget tree.
- It is not fully compile-time safe.
  - The injection of a provider that cannot be found in any scope results in a runtime error.

In Disco's defense regarding the last point:

- Total compile-time safety is not possible with an approach leveraging scoped DI, which is a pattern ubiquitously used in Flutter and third-party libraries (think about how many times you have already read `MediaQuery.of(context)`, `GoRouter.of(context)`, ...).
- Disco providers also have a `maybeOf(context)` method, which can help if the presence of a provider cannot be guaranteed.
- The throwable includes precise information in its stack trace to deduce the missing provider: filepath, line and column.

## Keep in mind: trade-offs

As the <a href="/authors">authors of Disco</a>, we believe this to be the most effective strategy for DI in Flutter. However, every solution has trade-offs. You can limit the impact of these trade-offs by running tests, doing code reviews, and following other crucial practices.
